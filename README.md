# ReelBites üéØ

## Basic Details

### Team Name
Impractical Coders

### Team Members
- **Team Lead:** Basil B Palathinkal ‚Äì Muthoot Institute of Technology & Science  
- **Member 2:** Meria Rachel Binu ‚Äì Muthoot Institute of Technology & Science  

### Project Description
ReelBites instantly locates food spots from Instagram Reels. Upload any food video, and our AI analyzes captions and metadata to pinpoint the exact restaurant ‚Äî turning foodie clips into real-world dining experiences. No more guessing ‚Äî just tap, find, and eat.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
How many times have you saved a food reel thinking *"I'll try this later"* ‚Äî only to forget where it was or drown it in a sea of saved videos? Scrolling through hundreds of reels to find that one dish is exhausting, and even then, half the time the location isn't tagged.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We use captions and metadata in Instagram Reels to accurately pinpoint the location and store it for future use ‚Äî perfect for when you need a quick bite and don‚Äôt want to waste time searching.
