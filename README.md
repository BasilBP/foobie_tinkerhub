Project Description
ReelBites instantly locates food spots from Instagram Reels. Upload any food video, and our AI analyzes captions and metadata to pinpoint the exact restaurant‚Äîturning foodie clips into real-world dining experiences. No more guessing‚Äîjust tap,find,and eat. 

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
How many times have you saved a food reel thinking "I'll try this later"‚Äîonly to forget where it was or drown it in a sea of saved videos? Scrolling through hundreds of reels to find that one dish is exhausting, and even then, half the time the location isn't tagged.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
we use the captions and the metadata in the instagram reels to accurateley pinpoint the location and store the locations for future use especially when you need a quick bite
